Description: BaHZING is an analysis tool used for environmental mixture exposures and other mixture exposures with hierarchical gut microbiome outcome data. BaHZING controls Type 1 error rates, multiple testing, stabilizes effect estimates with small sample sizes and Estimated stable effects with a small sample sizes and models the effects of a mixture of PFAS jointly on the gut microbiome.
