## Overview

This platform is dedicated to the analysis of environmental mixture exposures and other mixture exposures with hierarchical gut microbiome outcome data. BaHZING, short for Bayesian Hierarchical Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression with G-Computation, is a powerful toolkit designed to uncover intricate relationships between environmental exposures and gut microbiome outcomes.


## Installation

You can install `BaHZING` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with: 
``` r
# install.packages("BaHZING")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of `BaHZING` from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Goodrich-Lab/BaHZING")
```

## Input Requirements
The BaHZING formatting function requires a phyloseq object as the input. Ensure that your phyloseq object adheres to the required format. Refer to the phyloseq documentation for details on creating and manipulating phyloseq objects. 
For covariates in phyloseq object: All categorical covariates must be formatted as binary indicator variables rather than categorical or factor variables. 
For missing data: Ensure that there are no NA values in your data, perform the necessary filtering or imputation methods necessary to handle these values as BaHZING cannot function with missing data. 

## Output
The formatting function produces an object that contains a table with all exposure variables, all covariates and the lowest level of microbiome outcome data. Additionally, the function produces binary matrices that represent the relationship between each level of microbiome data and the level above it.

The BaHZING model function provides results from the Bayesian hierarchical zero-inflated negative binomial regression model.

## Example
For a quick start, we utilize data from the iHMP publicly available data set. This example will guide you through the process of using BaHZING for analyzing environmental mixture exposures with hierarchical gut microbiome outcome data.

```{r example}
library(BaHZING)
library(ggplot2)

### Load example data
data("iHMP_Reduced")

### Format microbiome data
formatted_data <- Format_BaHZING(iHMP_Reduced)

### Perform Bayesian hierarchical zero-inflated negative binomial regression with g-computation
### Specify a mixture of exposures
x <- c("soft_drinks_dietnum",
       "alcohol_dietnum", 
       "fruit_juice_dietnum")
# "fruit_juice_dietnum","water_dietnum",
# "alcohol_dietnum","yogurt_dietnum","dairy_dietnum","probiotic_dietnum",
# "fruits_no_juice_dietnum", "vegetables_dietnum","beans_soy_dietnum", 
# "whole_grains_dietnum","starch_dietnum", "eggs_dietnum", 
# "processed_meat_dietnum","red_meat_dietnum","white_meat_dietnum",
# "shellfish_dietnum","fish_dietnum", "sweets_dietnum"

### Specify a set of covariates
covar <- c("consent_age")

### Perform BaH-ZING
# NOTE: For this example, we are using a small number of iterations to reduce 
# the runtime. For a real analysis, we recommend using n.chain = 3, 
# n.adapt, n.burnin, and n.sample > 5000.
bahzing_resout <- BaHZING_Model(formatted_data,
                         x = x,
                         covar = covar,
                         exposure_standardization = "none",
                         counterfactual_profiles = c(0,1),
                         n.chains = 1,
                         n.adapt = 60,
                         n.iter.burnin = 2,
                         n.iter.sample = 50)
```



## Examine the results
```{r}
# Summarize the results 
## Lets examine the Count model coefficients
count_estimates <- bahzing_resout[bahzing_resout$component == "Count model coefficients", ]

# Lets look at only the family level results
family_res_out <- count_estimates[count_estimates$domain == "Family",]

# Having a probabilty of direction > 0.975 is equivalent to examining 
# whether the 95% BCI is overlapping with 0:
family_res_out$p_Dir_sig <-  ifelse(family_res_out$pdir > 0.975, 
                                    "pDIR Sig", "pDIR Not Sig")

# Plot the genus results
ggplot(family_res_out, aes(x = estimate, y = taxa_name, color = p_Dir_sig)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = bci_lcl, xmax = bci_ucl), width = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  facet_grid(~exposure) +
  theme_classic() + 
  labs(title = "Family-level count model results",
       x = "Log fold-change",
       y = "Family",
       color = "Probability of Direction")
```
